            <h1>Nikhil Chinapa</h1>
            <article>
                <p>To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his career, is like saying it snows in
                    Alaska; a bit of an understatement. He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival
                    Director —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital Design. A year later and for reasons
                    that scientists are still trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think it’ll be fun.”
                    For once, he was right.</p>

            <article>
                <p>At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired. From MTV Select – MTV’s longest
                    running show, (it aired continuously for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on
                    Roadies as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.</p>

                <p>Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real job.</p>

            <article>
                <p>As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first love, music. In 2001, a
                    conversation between friends resulted in the launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest
                    Indian Electronic Dance Music (EDM) company in India.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well… whatever he feels like. His sets are
                    moody, varied, often erratic but usually fun. Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping and the
                    random flailing of arms – sometimes by him. They also feature music – the kind that has a repetitive
                    monotonous beat and is best enjoyed at dangerous decibel levels.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Nikhil was also the co-founder of Sunburn. He is now the Festival Curator and partner of Vh1
                    Supersonic, Goa’s brand new beach music festival.</p>
